  Bio: 'In his large-scale paintings, James Jean depicts detailed cosmological worlds filled with allegorical and contemporary imagery. He incorporates elements of traditional Chinese and Japanese scroll paintings, Japanese woodblock prints, Renaissance portraiture, comic books, and anime into these complex compositions. As he experiments with such different styles and art historical genres, Jean diminishes the boundary between new and old, and between Eastern and Western artmaking.',
